          <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <p>My story begins in the Los Angeles entertainment industry, and continues here with web development. Originally, I focused my career on all things public relations, marketing and communications. I figured since I had earned my degree in Communications, that was the direction I needed to go!</p>
          <p>I jumped into my first job at The Walt Disney Company in the Consumer Products division, focusing on all things PR for action figures, collectibles, wedding dresses &mdash; you name it! It was there that I got my first look into HTML as we used it to publish press materials online.</p>
          <p>Following Disney, I migrated back up to the Central Valley of California to be closer to family. I soon found myself at a local regional craft brewery wearing many communications hats. Again, I got a taste of web development as I was tasked with collaborating with a designer and developer to relaunch our website. And I LOVED it!</p>
          <p>After a couple years at the brewery, I finally decided to take a leap of faith and answer the nagging feeling I had that web development was my calling. I completed courses with Skillcrush and blossomed into the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WordPress. Everything finally clicked. This is the work I'm meant to do!</p>
          <p>I now spend my days pouring over code and absorbing myself in development projects. I enjoy splitting my time between San Diego with my boyfriend and Turlock with my family. I fill any freetime with puzzles, sunshine and reading.</p>
